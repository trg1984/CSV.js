CSV.js
======

Fully [RFC 4180](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) compliant CSV file format importer, exporter and handler.
CSV.js is written in pure JavaScript and it does not have any dependencies on other libraries (and it never will).

MIT licence, although I'd appreciate if you sent me your modifications if they improve on CSV file
handling.
